# Generate Strong Passwords

This project provides a strong password generator implemented in both HTML/JavaScript and C++. It generates secure passwords and checks them for strength.

## Features

- HTML/JavaScript-based password generator with a simple and user-friendly interface.
- C++ implementation for generating and checking strong passwords.
- Prohibited words or patterns checking to ensure passwords don't contain common, weak terms.
- Strong password criteria, including length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

## Usage

- Open the HTML/JavaScript password generator by running `index.html` in a web browser.
- Use the "Generate Password" button to generate a strong and secure password.

## C++ Password Generation

The C++ code, `password_generator.cpp`, provides a command-line tool to generate strong passwords. It checks for prohibited words and ensures password strength.

### To run the C++ code:

```bash
g++ password_generator.cpp -o password_generator
./password_generator
